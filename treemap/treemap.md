* Towards Automated Infographic Design: Deep Learning-based Auto-Generation of Extensible Timeline.
  * **Info:** IEEE TVCG 2019
  * **Authors:** Zhutian Chen, Yun Wang, Qianwen Wang, Yong Wang, and Huamin Qu
  * **Contribution:**  an automated approach to extracting extensible templates from bitmap infographic timelines. The approach consists of 1) a multi-task DNN that automatically deconstructs bitmap timeline infographics(parse global and local information) and 2) a pipeline that automatically reconstructs extensible templates (Non-Maximum Merging,Redundancy Recover,and DL GrabCut)
